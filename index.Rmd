# phonenumber

**`phonenumber`** is an R package that converts English letters to numbers or
numbers to English letters as on a telephone keypad.

### Background

When I recently posted some of my [Turbo Pascal Stuff](http://steve.mylesandmyles.info/projects/turbo-pascal-stuff/), I found an incomplete 
program that was supposed to do this. I was active on [BBSes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) and, though I don't 
recall the reason, I wanted a way to determine the possible words spelled by the
BBS phone numbers (and/or how to determine what phone numbers correspond to 
words/phrases). I never got around to finishing the second part (numbers to 
letters) in Turbo Pascal, though.

I decided to create this functionality in R for three reasons:

1. to see if I could write the functions
2. to learn to publish a package to CRAN
3. to serve as a possible pedagogical example for others as it involves working 
with lists, splitting strings, and the [expand.grid](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/expand.grid.html) function.

### Installation

* `phonenumber` is available [on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phonenumber/index.html) and can be
installed accordingly:
```r
install.packages("phonenumber")
library(phonenumber)
```
* You can also install `phonenumber` from GitHub using the `devtools` package:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("scumdogsteev/phonenumber")
library(phonenumber)
```
