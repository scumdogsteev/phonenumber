    letters as on a telephone keypad. When converting letters to numbers,
    a character vector is returned with "A," "B," or "C" becoming 2, "D,"
    "E", or "F" becoming 3, etc. When converting numbers to letters, a
    character vector is returned with multiple elements (i.e., "2" becomes
    a vector of "A," "B," and "C").
